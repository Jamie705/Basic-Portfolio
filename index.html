            <p>Hello my name is Jamie. I am a Technical Product Specialist. I am part of the Product Management team, my responsibilities
                are in maintaining our product, from research and concept to assist in development and testing. I analyze
                business needs for clients and provide custom software according to their technical needs. I also wWrite
                technical tools such as product support documentation, and training content. Test hardware, firmware, software
                and provide engineers with feedback on design and development. I serve as technical support to sales team
                and customer service.</p>

            <p>I have always had intrest in how things work. I am naturally captivated by technology, computers, and the internet.
                I had the oportunity to learn how to build a computer from scratch, and build a network to see computers
                interact with each other. The need for knowledge brings me to where I am today. Web site building and seeing
                how a site interacts with databases is my next step. Web development has always been a huge intrest. Since
                computers are such a major part of my dayily life things like scrolling through the internet, playing video
                games, and using phone apps provide the curiosity to learn how I can be part of todays technology.</p>
